### **Project Title**: Interactive Resume Builder

### **Description**:
This project is a milestone-based interactive resume builder created for a hackathon. The project allows users to create, view, and interact with their resumes in a dynamic and user-friendly format. The resume builder will evolve over multiple milestones, starting with a static resume and progressing to an editable, dynamic version with sharing capabilities.

### **Technologies Used**:
- **HTML**: Structure the content of the resume.
- **CSS**: Style and ensure the responsiveness of the design across devices.


### **Current Milestone**: 
Milestone 1 â€“ Static Interactive Resume: This version of the resume is static but includes basic interactivity (like toggling sections) using TypeScript.

   
### **Live Version**:
A live version of the project is deployed on Vercel. You can access it [here](https://your-project-name.vercel.app).

### **Future Milestones**:
- **Milestone 2**: Publish on GitHub and deploy live via Vercel.
- **Milestone 3**: Add dynamic form to generate a resume based on user input.
- **Milestone 4**: Implement edit-in-place functionality for users to modify sections directly.
- **Milestone 5**: Create a unique URL for each resume and allow the resume to be shared and downloaded as a PDF.
